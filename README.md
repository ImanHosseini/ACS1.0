Android Cloth Sim 1.0
This is a simple android opengl sample I made. <br />
It simulates a cloth, with an array of springs and masses, and a probabilistic model for wind. Also there is friction proprotional to speed, to dampen 
the movement. It is my very first android thing, my "Hello World" actually. <br />
The model for wind is very simplistic but that wasn't what I was after, I just wanted to make the rendering work, so that I can 
later tinker with different wind models, and further optimize the calculations etc. <br />
Also the coordinates are just so awful and absouletly do not scale, and as they are calibrated to my Samsung S6 expect them to be off 
the charts! The code though is hard to understand (I hope). <br />
It is a nice benchmark to see how smart phones hold up when calculations get tense, just crank up the node numbers in the code and let
'em have it.
